    <p class="quote">GOOD IDEAS STARTS WITH BRAINSTORMING. GREAT IDEAS START WITH COFFEE</p>
    <p class="para">There is nothing better than sipping a good cup of coffee. It becomes a companion on lonely days or
        days that
        reading, or maybe writing, is all that matters. Coffee is just like life. The smooth liquid never fails to give
        joy or satisfaction whenever it is being drank. It may be bitter like the challenges we face, but it can be
        strong like what we should be during challenges. It may be sweet and bursting with different flavors like life
        when things seem to go perfectly well. There are endless combinations of coffee that could be drank, it’s always
        up to us to find the right one.</p><br>

            <h3>Black</h3>
            <p class="p1">Black coffee is simply coffee that is normally brewed without the addition of additives such
                as sugar,
                milk, cream, or added flavors. While it has a slightly bitter taste compared to when it is flavored with
                additives, many people love a strong cup of black coffee.<br><br></p>

            <h3>Latte</h3>
            <p class="p1"> One of the most popular types of speciality coffee drinks is the latte. Latte is the Italian
                word for
                milk, which makes sense since it contains espresso and steamed milk. Latte is actually a shortened
                version of the Italian cafe latte, which means milk coffee.

            <h3>cappuccino</h3>
            <p class="p1">Perfected and made popular during both World Wars, a cappuccino starts with a bottom layer of
                one or two
                shots of espresso (typically two in the United States). A second layer of steamed milk is added on top,
                followed by a thick and airy layer of foam to lend the drink a luxurious velvety texture.</p>

            <h3>Americano</h3>
            <p class="p1">Americano is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it
                a similar
                strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano varies
                with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added.</p>

            <h3>Espresso</h3>
            <p class="p1">Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly
                boiling water is
                forced under 9–10 bars of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with
                a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees.</p>

            <h3>Mocha</h3>
            <p class="p1">A café mocha, also called mocaccino, is a chocolate-flavoured warm beverage that is a variant
                of a café
                latte, commonly served in a glass rather than a mug. Other commonly used spellings are mochaccino and
                also mochachino.</p>

            <h3>Macchiatto</h3>
            <p class="p1">Caffè macchiato, sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small
                amount of
                milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted" so the literal translation of
                caffè macchiato is "stained” or “marked coffee.”</p>

            <h3>Irish</h3>
            <p class="p1">Irish coffee is a cocktail consisting of hot coffee, Irish whiskey, and sugar, stirred, and
                topped with
                cream. The coffee is drunk through the cream. Its main ingredients are 1 1/3 oz (2 parts) Irish whiskey,
                1 oz (1½ parts) Fresh cream, 1 tsp. Brown sugar, 2 2/3 oz (4 parts) Hot coffee</p>
